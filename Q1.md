My updated Google Sheets document can be seen here: [Shopify Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10dI7JRee3kYhBC5rzm1PmgDwfQpSHy7HFJf0HYijVCI/edit?usp=sharing)

a. When looking at this data there are several orders that are outliers from the rest of the data.  
There is a massive amount of money being spent on these orders compared to the rest.  
Most orders are in between $300-600 while there are some orders above $500,000.  This highly skewes the AOV value.

b. One option would be to delete the outliers but I would rather not do that.  
Instead I would take into account the number of items being ordered per order as well.  
So instead of AOV, I would calculate the average order value per item (AOVPI).  
By taking into account the number of items the customer bought this will level the playing field for all kinds of orders no matter how much or little is spent.

I created a new column in the table called average_cost_item as seen in link above

Average_cost_item = (order_amount/total_items)

Then took the average of the entire average_cost_item column to get a single value as seen in link above.

AOVPI = AVERAGE(average_cost_item)

c. **$387.74.**  This aligns more with the overall data set.  
Some of the values in AOVPI are still high but the amount of data doesnâ€™t skew the overall value that much.
